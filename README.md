Yandell's Geospatial Workshops Play Area

This is now a library. Note that all needed packages are listed as Depends _except_ `basemapR`. You can install as follows without cloning the library:

```
devtools::install_github('Chrisjb/basemapR')
devtools::install_github('byandell/geospatial')
```

There is a draft shiny app for the `redline` example at this point, which will mature. Try

```
library(geospatial)
redlineApp()
```
